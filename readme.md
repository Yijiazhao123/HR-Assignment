# UTSC MGTC28 Exercise

Hi everyone, this exercise is to allow you to get some experience on some type of requests you may get once you enter the workforce. As a newbie to the organization, your team is likely going to ask you to do some small tasks to get you situated with the project. This can include fixing some small bugs, adding a nice-to-have feature, or doing a quick lookup of some data.

## Setting up the project

I normally create a python virtual environment when working with python scripts. This ensures that all the packages that I will be using for this project are the correct version for this specific project, and that it is not using my global installation.

In order to set up the project, do the following:

1. Open a terminal/shell/command prompt at this folder.

2. Navigate to src using `cd src`.

3. Execute `python -m venv virtualenv` <- this command creates the virtual environment.

4. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` <- this command installs all the packages listed in requirements file.

### Running the Streamlit application

---

In the src directory execute `python -m streamlit run ./main.py` in the terminal.
